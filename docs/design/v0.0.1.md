# version 0.0.1

in order to make some progress I am designing a sort of minimal viable product.


requirements:
- function declarations
- function calls (void, and non-void)
- if statements
- constant function parameters (no stack alloc)
- types: int, float, bool
- system calls (print, maybe some other io)
- variable declaration
- variable assignment
